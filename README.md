### Odin Project Task
This task as undertaken during the course of the odin project javascript curricilum.
I am to create a tic tac toe game in the browser, focusing on encapsulating my code as much as possible.
Making sure to minimize idle codes as much as possible and package much of my codes in functions.
Also, the project recommnends to make use of objects.
